# Replit Deployment Port Configuration Fix

## Problem Identified:
Your `.replit` file has multiple port configurations which is causing deployment failures:

```
[[ports]]
localPort = 3000
externalPort = 3000

[[ports]]
localPort = 5000
externalPort = 80

[[ports]]
localPort = 24678
externalPort = 3001
```

## Issue:
According to Replit documentation, "Autoscale and Reserved VM deployments only support a single external port being exposed."

## Solution:
Your app runs on port 5000 and should only expose that port. Remove the other port configurations.

The correct configuration should be:
```
[[ports]]
localPort = 5000
externalPort = 80
```

## Steps to Fix:
1. Open your `.replit` file
2. Remove the port configurations for 3000 and 24678
3. Keep only the 5000 â†’ 80 mapping
4. Try deployment again

This single port configuration will resolve the deployment failures you've been experiencing.
