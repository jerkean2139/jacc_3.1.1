# Vercel Build Fix - JACC Deployment

## Problem Identified: Build Hanging During Transformation

The Vercel build was getting stuck during the "transforming..." phase, which is common with complex full-stack applications that have large dependency trees.

## Solution Applied:

### 1. Simplified Vercel Configuration
- Changed from package.json build to explicit API structure
- Using `@vercel/node` for serverless functions
- Using `@vercel/static` for frontend assets

### 2. Created Minimal Test API
- Simplified `api/index.ts` with basic Express server
- Added health check endpoint at `/api/health`
- Removed complex dependency loading that was causing hangs

### 3. Configuration Changes:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "api/index.ts",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    },
    {
      "src": "dist/public/**",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps:
1. Commit these changes to GitHub
2. Trigger new Vercel deployment
3. Test `/api/health` endpoint
4. Gradually integrate full JACC functionality

## Expected Result:
- Build should complete without hanging
- Basic API endpoints should work
- Frontend static files should serve correctly

This approach prioritizes getting a working deployment first, then incrementally adding features.
