## System Architecture
JACC is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) combining a React 18 (with TypeScript) frontend, a Node.js (with Express.js and TypeScript) backend, and a PostgreSQL database.

### Frontend
- **Frameworks**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter (routing), TanStack Query (state management).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui and Radix UI for accessible components.
- **Features**: PWA capabilities for mobile use.

### Backend
- **Core**: Node.js with Express.js, TypeScript.
- **Authentication**: Session-based with PostgreSQL session store, multi-factor authentication, role-based access control (sales-agent, client-admin, dev-admin), ISO Hub SSO integration.
- **API**: RESTful, modular service architecture for AI, search, and document processing.

### Database
- **Type**: PostgreSQL (Neon).
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM.
- **Schema**: Supports users, chats, documents, vendors, monitoring, and vector embeddings.

### Key Components
- **AI Integration**: Primary language models are Claude 4 Sonnet (latest Jan 2025 release) and OpenAI GPT-4.1 Mini. Fallback models are Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI GPT-4o Mini. Utilizes Pinecone for vector search, custom prompt chaining, and AI orchestration.
- **Document Processing**: Simplified approach leveraging native LLM document analysis capabilities for PDF, CSV, text, and image files. Modern AI models provide superior document understanding without complex OCR pipelines. Documents are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM.
- **ISO Hub Integration**: SSO authentication, token-based authentication, CORS configuration, and iframe embedding support with PostMessage communication for seamless integration with external merchant services platforms.
- **Performance Optimization**: Includes in-memory vector caching (LRU eviction), query optimization (expansion, intent detection, domain-specific terms, rewriting), search result reranking (multi-signal scoring), and configurable batch processing with job queue management and error handling.
- **Security**: Production-ready security implementation with mandatory SESSION_SECRET validation, proper API key authentication, restrictive CSP headers (no unsafe-eval), environment-specific CORS policies, generic error handling in production, comprehensive audit logging, role-based access control, session security (7-day timeout, SameSite strict), multi-tier rate limiting, CSRF protection, and account lockout mechanisms. All critical security vulnerabilities from audit have been resolved.

### UI/UX Decisions
- Professional and clean design with cockpit-style interface for admin panels.
- Consistent color schemes, particularly using gradients and color-coded status indicators (green/yellow/red).
- Emphasis on clear visual hierarchy, accessible components, and responsive design for mobile.
- AI responses are formatted with HTML for improved readability, using structured layouts inspired by direct response marketing.

### System Design Choices
- **Scalability**: Designed with auto-scaling policies and performance monitoring for production.
- **Modularity**: Services are decoupled for easier maintenance and development.
- **Data Flow**: Defined flows for user authentication, chat processing (query to AI response), and document processing (upload to vector storage).
- **Deployment**: Production-ready for Vercel deployment with 60-second function timeouts, native TypeScript support, and comprehensive serverless configuration. Netlify configuration also available but not recommended due to timeout limitations for AI processing.

## External Dependencies
- **AI Services**: Anthropic Claude API, OpenAI API, Pinecone (vector database).
- **Cloud Services**: Neon PostgreSQL (cloud database hosting), Google Drive API (optional document synchronization), Google Service Account (for Drive integration).
- **ISO Integrations**: ISO Hub Server, ISO AMP API (for merchant processing analysis tools).
