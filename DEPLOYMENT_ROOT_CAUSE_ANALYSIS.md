# DEPLOYMENT ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - 36th Failure

## IDENTIFIED PROBLEM
**Port Conflict**: Development and production servers both trying to use port 5000

## Evidence:
- Development server: PID 3875 on port 5000 ✓ (working)
- Production server: PID 4303 attempting port 5000 ❌ (fails with EADDRINUSE)
- Result: 500 Internal Server Error in deployment

## The Real Issue:
1. Replit deployment expects server on configured port (5000→80 mapping)
2. Development server already occupies port 5000
3. Production build fails to start due to port conflict
4. Deployment shows 500 error because no server is actually running

## Solution Strategy:
1. Use environment variable PORT to differentiate dev/prod
2. Development: PORT=5000 (current)
3. Production: PORT=3000 (new)
4. Update .replit port mapping: 3000→80 (requires manual configuration)

## Technical Details:
- Build working: 693KB frontend, 512KB backend ✓
- Code conflicts resolved: Vercel/Netlify files removed ✓ 
- Git push successful: 5 commits pushed ✓
- TypeScript error fixed: CORS type assertion ✓

## Status: Port configuration needs manual update in Replit console
