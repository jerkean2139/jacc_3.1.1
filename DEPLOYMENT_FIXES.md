# JACC Deployment Fixes

## Deployment Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing Test File Issue
**Problem**: Application trying to read missing test file '/test/data/05-versions-space.pdf' causing startup crashes

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `server/deployment-config.ts` to ensure production files exist
- Created `server/production-setup.ts` for comprehensive production environment setup
- Added test file placeholder creation during server initialization
- Modified `server/index.ts` to run deployment configuration before server start

**Files Modified**:
- `server/index.ts` - Added deployment configuration imports and initialization
- `server/deployment-config.ts` - Created deployment configuration utilities
- `server/production-setup.ts` - Created comprehensive production setup

### 2. Server Port Configuration
**Problem**: Server configured to run on port 5000 internally but proxy failing to connect

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated server to bind to `0.0.0.0` in production for external access
- Maintained `localhost` binding for development
- Added proper host configuration based on NODE_ENV
- Enhanced port configuration with environment variable support

**Configuration**:
```typescript
const port = process.env.PORT ? parseInt(process.env.PORT) : 5000;
const host = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "0.0.0.0" : "localhost";
server.listen(port, host, () => {
  log(`serving on ${host}:${port}`);
});
```

### 3. Build Process Dependencies
**Problem**: Build process not properly copying test data files to production environment

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added production directory structure creation
- Implemented test file placeholder generation
- Enhanced build process with proper file validation
- Added comprehensive environment validation

### 4. Error Handling for Missing Files
**Problem**: PDF parsing library failures when test files not found

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created valid PDF placeholder files to prevent library crashes
- Added graceful error handling for missing dependencies
- Implemented production-safe file structure creation
- Added environment validation before server startup

## Deployment Configuration Features

### Automatic File Structure Creation
The deployment configuration automatically creates:
- `test/data/` directory with required test files
- `uploads/` directory for file uploads
- `public/` directory for static files
- `dist/` directory for production builds
- `temp/` directory for temporary files

### Environment Validation
The system validates:
- NODE_ENV configuration
- PORT configuration
- DATABASE_URL presence
- Required directory structure
- Test file existence

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling for:
- Uncaught exceptions
- Unhandled promise rejections
- Graceful shutdown signals (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- Missing file dependencies

## Production Readiness Checklist

### ✅ Server Configuration
- [x] Port binding to 0.0.0.0 for external access
- [x] Environment-based host configuration
- [x] Proper error handling and logging
- [x] Graceful shutdown handling

### ✅ File Dependencies
- [x] Test data placeholder creation
- [x] Required directory structure
- [x] Upload directory configuration
- [x] Static file serving setup

### ✅ Environment Variables
- [x] PORT configuration support
- [x] NODE_ENV detection
- [x] DATABASE_URL validation
- [x] Production vs development settings

### ✅ Build Process
- [x] Vite build configuration
- [x] Server bundle creation with esbuild
- [x] Static file serving in production
- [x] Development hot reload support

## Deployment Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Production Start
```bash
npm run start
```

## Environment Variables Required

### Required for Deployment
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NODE_ENV=production` - Production environment flag
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 5000)

### Optional
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude AI service
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI services
- `PINECONE_API_KEY` - Vector database
- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` - Search enhancement

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Missing test file" error
**Solution**: The deployment configuration automatically creates placeholder files. If the error persists, check that the server has write permissions to create directories.

#### Issue: "Cannot connect to server"
**Solution**: Verify the server is binding to 0.0.0.0 in production. Check the deployment logs for the "serving on" message.

#### Issue: "Build process fails"
**Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and the NODE_ENV is set correctly during build.

#### Issue: "Database connection fails"
**Solution**: Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly and the PostgreSQL service is accessible.

## Monitoring and Health Checks

The deployment configuration includes:
- Production environment validation
- Required file existence checks
- Directory structure verification
- Environment variable validation
- Database connectivity testing

## Security Considerations

Production deployment includes:
- Secure error handling (no sensitive data in logs)
- Proper file permissions
- Environment variable validation
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Resource cleanup on exit

## Next Steps

1. Verify all environment variables are set
2. Test the build process with `npm run build`
3. Validate production start with `npm run start`
4. Monitor deployment logs for any remaining issues
5. Test application functionality in production environment

The deployment fixes ensure JACC can be deployed successfully on Replit or any cloud platform with proper environment configuration.
