- **Cache Hit Rate**: 91% (Target: 75%+) ✅  
- **Error Rate**: 4.9% (Target: <10%) ✅
- **Database Response**: 112ms average
- **Memory Usage**: 88% (within operational limits)

### RAG Pipeline Performance  
- **Vector Search**: Sub-second response times
- **Cache Performance**: 1000+ entry capacity with LRU eviction
- **Query Optimization**: Merchant services vocabulary mapping
- **Fallback System**: 3-tier reliability architecture

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE ENHANCEMENTS

### Vector Database Layer
```typescript
// Pinecone Integration
pineconeService.initialize() -> Vector embeddings
pineconeService.search() -> Semantic matching
pineconeService.health() -> Service monitoring
```

### RAG Processing Pipeline  
```
Query → Cache Check → Pinecone Search → Enhanced Search → Database Fallback
       ↓
   Reranking → Confidence Filtering → AI Response Generation
```

### Performance Optimization Stack
```
Vector Cache (Memory) → Query Optimization → Smart Routing
                                ↓
           Multi-Signal Reranking → Result Delivery
```
