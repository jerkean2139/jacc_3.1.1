# FAQ Search Instructions and Optimization

## FAQ Search Priority System

### Search Hierarchy
```
SEARCH ORDER (Execute sequentially):
1. EXACT MATCH: Search for exact question phrasing in FAQ database
2. KEYWORD MATCH: Search for key terms and phrases
3. SEMANTIC MATCH: Search for conceptually related questions
4. CATEGORY MATCH: Search within relevant FAQ categories
5. FALLBACK: Provide general guidance if no matches found
```

### Question Matching Patterns

#### Processing Rate Questions
```
TRIGGER PATTERNS:
- "processing rates for [business type]"
- "what are the rates for [processor]"
- "calculate processing costs"
- "compare rates between [processor A] and [processor B]"
- "[business type] processing rates"

SEARCH STRATEGY:
1. Look for business-type specific rate information
2. Check processor-specific rate comparisons
3. Find rate calculation methodologies
4. Locate industry benchmarks
```

#### Processor Comparison Questions
```
TRIGGER PATTERNS:
- "compare [processor A] vs [processor B]"
- "which is better [processor A] or [processor B]"
- "differences between [processor A] and [processor B]"
- "pros and cons of [processor]"
- "[processor] review"

SEARCH STRATEGY:
1. Look for direct comparison articles
2. Check individual processor profiles
3. Find feature comparison charts
4. Locate user experience reviews
```

#### Technical Support Questions
```
TRIGGER PATTERNS:
- "how to [technical action]"
- "[processor] setup instructions"
- "troubleshooting [problem]"
- "integration with [POS system]"
- "[error message] fix"

SEARCH STRATEGY:
1. Search technical documentation
2. Look for setup guides
3. Find troubleshooting articles
4. Check integration instructions
```

- Finally by general rate information

FOR COMPARISON QUESTIONS:
- Search for direct A vs B comparisons
- Individual processor profiles
- Feature matrices
- User testimonials

FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS:
- Search by specific error message or problem
- Search by processor + technical term
- Search by integration type
- Search general technical category
```

## Enhanced Search Algorithms

### Semantic Matching
```
IMPLEMENT SEMANTIC SEARCH:
1. Extract key concepts from user question
2. Find FAQ entries with similar concepts
3. Score relevance based on concept overlap
4. Rank results by semantic similarity

EXAMPLE:
User: "What's the cheapest processor for restaurants?"
Semantic Concepts: [cost, pricing, restaurant, food service]
Match: FAQ about "restaurant processing rate comparisons"
```

### Context-Aware Search
```
USE CONVERSATION CONTEXT:
- Previous questions asked
- Business type mentioned
- Processors discussed
- Specific needs identified

EXAMPLE:
Previous: "I have a restaurant client"
Current: "What are the rates?"
Context-Enhanced Search: "restaurant processing rates"
```

### Multi-Stage Search
```
STAGE 1: Direct Match
- Exact question phrasing
- Common variations

STAGE 2: Keyword Match  
- Important terms from question
- Synonyms and variations

STAGE 3: Conceptual Match
- Related topics and themes
- Broader category searches

STAGE 4: Fallback
- General information
- "What I can help with instead"
```

## Response Formatting

### FAQ Match Response
```
WHEN FAQ MATCH FOUND:
"Based on our FAQ knowledge base, here's the answer to your question:

**[FAQ Question Title]**

[FAQ Answer Content]

**Related Information:**
- [Related FAQ 1]
- [Related FAQ 2]
- [Related FAQ 3]

**Need more specific help?** Let me know your exact situation and I can provide more targeted guidance."
```

### Multiple Match Response
```
WHEN MULTIPLE MATCHES FOUND:
"I found several relevant answers in our knowledge base:

**Most Relevant:**
[Top match with brief preview]

**Also Helpful:**
- [Match 2 title]
- [Match 3 title]
- [Match 4 title]

Which of these addresses your specific question, or would you like me to provide information on all of them?"
```

### No Match Response
```
WHEN NO FAQ MATCH:
"I didn't find an exact match for your question in our FAQ knowledge base. Let me search our document library for related information...

[Search document library]

If no documents found:
"While I don't have this specific information in our current knowledge base, I can:
1. Provide general industry information on this topic
2. Search external sources for current information
3. Add this to our knowledge base for future reference

What would be most helpful?"
```

## Quality Scoring

### Relevance Scoring Algorithm
```
SCORING FACTORS:
- Exact keyword matches (40 points)
- Semantic similarity (30 points)
- Category relevance (20 points)

THRESHOLD SCORES:
- 80+ points: High confidence match
- 60-79 points: Good match
- 40-59 points: Moderate match
- Under 40: Low confidence
```

### Response Confidence Indicators
```
HIGH CONFIDENCE (80+ score):
"Here's the exact information you're looking for:"

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (60-79 score):
"This should address your question:"

LOW CONFIDENCE (40-59 score):
"This might be helpful for your situation:"

VERY LOW CONFIDENCE (Under 40):
