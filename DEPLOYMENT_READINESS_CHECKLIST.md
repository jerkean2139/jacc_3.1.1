**DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATION**: 🔴 **NOT READY**

Critical memory management issues must be resolved before production deployment. Current 95%+ memory usage presents significant stability risks that could result in system crashes and poor user experience.

**ESTIMATED TIME TO DEPLOYMENT READY**: 6-8 hours of focused optimization work

**NEXT STEPS**: Implement memory optimization, fix session management, and conduct comprehensive testing before considering deployment.
