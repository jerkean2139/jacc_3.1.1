- Choose **Static** or **Reserved Deployment**
- Click "Custom Domain" and enter your domain (e.g., yourapp.com)

- (Optional) Use Cloudflare for free SSL and CDN

### 2. Add Getting Started Page for Mobile Users
Create a route like `/getting-started` with:
- App summary
- Add-to-home-screen instructions (iOS: Share > Add to Home Screen, Android: Menu > Add to Home Screen)

Add a `manifest.json` and a `service-worker.js` with PWA basics to support offline and installation capabilities.
