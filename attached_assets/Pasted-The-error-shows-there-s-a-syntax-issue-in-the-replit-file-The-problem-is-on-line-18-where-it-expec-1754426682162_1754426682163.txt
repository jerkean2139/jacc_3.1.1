The error shows there's a syntax issue in the .replit file. The problem is on line 18 where it expects a value for ports.externalPort but found a newline instead.
Here's the corrected .replit file:
tomlmodules = ["nodejs-20", "web", "postgresql-16"]
run = "npm run dev"
hidden = [".config", ".git", "generated-icon.png", "node_modules", "dist"]

[nix]
channel = "stable-24_05"
packages = ["tesseract", "imagemagick", "graphicsmagick", "chromium", "jq", "util-linux"]

[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
build = ["npm", "run", "build"]
run = ["npm", "run", "start"]
ignorePorts = false

[[ports]]
localPort = 3000
externalPort = 80

[env]
NODE_ENV = "production"
PORT = "3000"

[workflows]
runButton = "Project"

[[workflows.workflow]]
name = "Project"
mode = "parallel"
author = "agent"

[[workflows.workflow.tasks]]
task = "workflow.run"
args = "Start application"

[[workflows.workflow]]
name = "Start application"
author = "agent"

[[workflows.workflow.tasks]]
task = "shell.exec"
args = "npm run dev"
waitForPort = 3000
The issue was that externalPort = 80 needed to be on the same line or properly formatted. I've made sure all the TOML syntax is correct.
To fix this:

Click "Recover original configuration files" button if you want to go back to your original config
Or copy the corrected .replit file above and paste it into your .replit file
Save the file
The error should clear and your app should start

The key fix was ensuring the [[ports]] section has both values properly defined:

localPort = 3000
externalPort = 80

Once you fix this, your app should load properly. Let me know if you encounter any other errors!RetryJKhere is what the next screen showed :EditGood progress! The app is starting but crashing at runtime. The error shows an OAuth configuration issue. Based on the error message, the app is looking for OAuth credentials (CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET) or Google library is disabled.
Let's fix this step by step:
1. First, check if you have an OAuth configuration file
Look for a file that might be handling OAuth, likely in your server directory. It could be named something like:

server/auth.ts
server/oauth.ts
server/google-auth.ts
server/lib/oauth.ts

2. Quick Fix - Add these to your .env file:
env# Add these to your existing .env file
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="optional-not-configured"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="optional-not-configured"
OAUTH_ENABLED="false"
3. Or, if you want to properly disable OAuth, find where it's initialized
The error suggests the OAuth initialization is happening early in the startup. Look in your server/index.ts or any imported modules for Google OAuth initialization.
4. Check your imports in server/index.ts
Look for any imports like:
typescriptimport { setupOAuth } from "./oauth";
import { googleAuth } from "./auth";
// or
import { googleapis } from "googleapis";
5. Temporary workaround - Comment out OAuth
If you find OAuth initialization code, you can temporarily comment it out to get the app running:
typescript// Comment out OAuth setup temporarily
// await setupOAuth(app);
// or
// initializeGoogleAuth();
Can you:

Share any OAuth-related files you have?
Or search your codebase for "googleapis" or "OAuth" or "CLIENT_ID"?
Check if there's an auth or oauth related file in your server directory?

This will help me provide the exact fix for your OAuth configuration issue.
For now, try adding those environment variables to your .env file and restart the app. That might be enough to get past this error.RetryJKi dont need google for anything in thisEditPerfect! Let's disable Google OAuth completely since you don't need it.
Quick Fix - Add to your .env file:
env# Add these lines to disable Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="disabled"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="disabled"
OAUTH_ENABLED="false"
DISABLE_GOOGLE_AUTH="true"
Find and Remove/Comment Out Google Dependencies
Search your codebase for where googleapis is being imported. It's likely in one of these files:

server/index.ts
server/consolidated-routes.ts
Any auth-related file

Look for code like:
typescriptimport { googleapis } from "googleapis";
// or
import { google } from "googleapis";
And comment it out or remove it.
Check your server/consolidated-routes.ts or similar files
Since the error happens after "Routes registered", the Google OAuth is likely being initialized in your routes. Look for any route handlers that use Google auth and comment them out.
If you can't find it, try this diagnostic approach:

Add this to the very top of your server/index.ts after the imports:

typescript// Disable Google OAuth
process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = "disabled";
process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = "disabled";
process.env.OAUTH_ENABLED = "false";

Or create a quick patch by searching all TypeScript files:

bash# Run this in your terminal to find Google OAuth usage
grep -r "googleapis" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
grep -r "CLIENT_ID" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
This will show you exactly which files are trying to use Google OAuth, and we can then disable those specific parts.
Try adding those environment variables first and restart. If it still crashes, share what files show up from the grep search and I'll help you disable them properly.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
