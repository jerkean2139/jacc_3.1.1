üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES FOUND - MUST FIX BEFORE PRODUCTION
‚ùå HIGH PRIORITY SECURITY FIXES REQUIRED
CRITICAL: Fallback Session Secret

Issue: server/middleware/auth.ts:29 uses 'fallback-secret-key' as default
Risk: Session hijacking, authentication bypass
Fix: Remove fallback, require SESSION_SECRET environment variable
// CURRENT (INSECURE):
secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET || 'fallback-secret-key',

// SHOULD BE:
secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET || (() => { throw new Error('SESSION_SECRET is required') })(),
CRITICAL: Incomplete API Key Validation

Issue: server/middleware/security-middleware.ts:178 has TODO for actual API key validation
Risk: Unauthorized API access
Fix: Implement proper API key validation against database
CRITICAL: Sensitive Files in Repository

Issue: Multiple session/cookie files committed to repository
Risk: Credential exposure
Files to remove: All *cookies.txt, *session.txt, auth_*.txt files
Fix: Run git rm on these files and ensure .gitignore is working
‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY SECURITY ISSUES
CSP Headers Too Permissive

Issue: 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' in CSP
Risk: XSS vulnerabilities
Fix: Remove unsafe directives, use nonces for inline scripts
CORS Configuration

Issue: Allows all Replit domains
Risk: Cross-origin attacks
Fix: Restrict to specific production domains only
Error Information Disclosure

Issue: Detailed error messages in production
Risk: Information leakage
Fix: Generic error messages in production
‚úÖ SECURITY FIXES COMPLETED
‚úÖ Added missing setupSecurity function
‚úÖ Created comprehensive .env.example
‚úÖ Updated .gitignore to exclude sensitive files
‚úÖ Added memory optimization functions
