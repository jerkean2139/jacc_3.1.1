# Project Overview
Develop "JACC" — an AI-powered assistant for independent sales agents that centralizes documents, answers repetitive questions, compares pricing data, and includes conversational voice features. JACC runs as both a standalone PWA and a modular React-Node component that integrates into your ISO Hub platform.

# Core Functionality
- Agent login with personalized sessions (user-specific data & folders)
- Left panel: collapsible folder system for projects and stored documents
- Right panel: live AI chat interface (ChatGPT-style), with voice support
- Persistent chat history per agent, grouped by project or client
- Upload + parse PDF/image files for AI assistance
- AI responds to user-driven prompts with:
  - Document links (from Google Drive)
  - File previews (PDF/image)
  - Summaries
  - “Save to folder” action when prompted
- Reads a dynamic Google Sheet (top 50+ Q&A, continuously updated)
- Executes rate comparisons & savings projections from spreadsheet data
- Admin feedback sheet to fine-tune bad answers (Question → Response → Fix)
- Agents can tag files or chats as “Favorites” for quick reuse
- Editable PDF flyer library (pre-branded, fillable)

# Visual Design Requirements
- Layout modeled after ChatGPT:
  - Left: folders/projects
  - Right: chat window
- Aesthetic: Modern minimalist meets bold tech
- Colors: Navy blue (primary), neon olive green (accent)
- Elements: Rounded buttons, light hover effects, intuitive toggles
- Design simplicity for non-technical users

# Voice Conversation Features
- Enable Web Speech API (frontend) or Whisper (backend)
  - Voice-to-text for prompts
  - Optional text-to-speech for replies
- (Future) “Snarkiness dial” to personalize tone/responses

# Data & Integration Points
- Google Drive: Source for all public and agent-accessible docs

# Technical Stack

- Database: Firestore or MongoDB
- File Handling: Multer (Express middleware)
- Voice API: Web Speech API or Whisper

# Additional Features

- Agent document “Favorites” and “Recents”
- Admin dashboard for doc updates, chat training, and QA fixes
