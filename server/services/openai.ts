IMPORTANT: Always respond in a natural, conversational way - like you're talking to a colleague. Don't use numbered lists or bullet points unless specifically asked. Instead, flow naturally from one thought to the next.

When discussing topics like marketing:
- Share insights conversationally, weaving ideas together naturally
- Talk about strategies as if you're having a friendly business discussion
- Suggest approaches in a narrative way, not as a list

Your expertise includes:
- Payment processing rates and fee comparisons
- POS systems (SkyTab, Clover, terminals)
- Business payment solutions and savings calculations
- Cash discounting and surcharge programs
- Sales and marketing strategies for merchant services
- Client proposals and deal closing techniques

Always format your responses using HTML for better readability:
- Use <h2> for main topics
- Use <p> for paragraphs
- Use <strong> for emphasis
- Use <ul><li> ONLY when the user specifically asks for a list

<h2>Let's talk marketing strategy! üéØ</h2>

<p>Hey there! Marketing in merchant services is all about building trust and demonstrating value. I'd love to help you create a winning approach.</p>

<p>Think about it this way - every business owner you talk to is already paying processing fees, right? They're just not sure if they're getting a good deal. That's where your expertise comes in. You're not just selling a service, you're offering peace of mind and real savings.</p>

<div class="strategy-insight">
<h3>Here's what's working for top performers:</h3>
<p>The most successful agents I work with focus on education over selling. They share insights about hidden fees, explain how interchange works, and show real examples of businesses they've helped save money. It's about positioning yourself as a trusted advisor, not just another salesperson.</p>
</div>

<div class="action-tip">
<p><strong>Quick win:</strong> Start by analyzing one of your current clients' statements and create a before-and-after comparison. Use that as a case study in your outreach. Real numbers speak louder than any sales pitch.</p>
</div>

<p>What type of businesses are you targeting? I can share more specific strategies based on your market.</p>
</div>`;

  // Check if comparing processors
  if (userInput.includes('compare') && (userInput.includes('processor') || userInput.includes('payment'))) {
    return `<div class="ai-response">
<h2>Let's compare payment processors! üìä</h2>

<p>Great question! Choosing the right processor can make a huge difference in your client's bottom line. I'll help you create a comparison that really resonates.</p>

<p>Here's the thing - most businesses don't realize how much processor choice impacts their profitability. It's not just about rates (though that's important). It's about reliability, support, integration capabilities, and hidden fees that can eat away at margins.</p>

<div class="comparison-insight">
<h3>Key factors to compare:</h3>
<p>When I help agents compare processors, we look at the complete picture. Sure, we start with processing rates and transaction fees, but we also dig into monthly minimums, PCI compliance costs, early termination fees, and equipment costs. The devil's really in the details here.</p>
</div>

<p>What type of business is this for? Retail, restaurant, e-commerce, or B2B? Each has different needs, and I can tailor the comparison to highlight what matters most for their specific situation.</p>
</div>`;

  // Check if creating a proposal

<h2>Let's create a winning proposal! üìã</h2>

<p>Excellent! A well-crafted proposal can be the difference between a maybe and a yes. I'll help you put together something that really showcases the value you bring.</p>

<p>The best proposals I've seen don't just list features and rates - they tell a story. They show the merchant exactly how switching to your solution will impact their business, with real numbers and clear benefits.</p>

<div class="proposal-strategy">
<h3>Building your proposal:</h3>
<p>Start with their current pain points. Maybe they're frustrated with hidden fees, poor customer service, or outdated equipment. Then show them a clear path to solving these issues. Use their actual processing volume to calculate savings - nothing speaks louder than showing them exactly how much money they'll keep in their pocket each month.</p>
</div>

<p>Do you have their current processing statement handy? If so, we can create a side-by-side comparison that really drives home the savings. What's the business name and what are their main concerns?</p>

<p>Perfect timing - helping merchants understand their true processing costs is one of the most valuable things you can do. I'll walk you through this step by step.</p>

<p>To give you the most accurate calculation, I'll need to know a few things about the business. Think of it like being a doctor - we need to diagnose before we can prescribe the right solution.</p>

<div class="info-request">
<p><strong>Here's what helps me create the best analysis:</strong></p>
<p>First, what type of business are we looking at? A restaurant processes differently than an e-commerce store, and a B2B company has completely different needs than retail. The business type affects everything from interchange rates to the best equipment options.</p>

<p>Also, do you have a sense of their monthly processing volume? Even a ballpark figure helps me show realistic savings projections.</p>
</div>

<p>Once I have those details, I can show you exactly how much they're currently paying versus what they could be saving with TracerPay's competitive rates. Ready to dig in?</p>
