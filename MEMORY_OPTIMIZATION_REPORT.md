# Memory Optimization Report (August 6, 2025)

## Problem Identified:
Memory usage at 97% (371MB+ VSZ) causing performance issues

## Optimizations Implemented:

### 1. Aggressive Memory Management
- **Reduced memory thresholds**: Warning at 70% (down from 85%), Critical at 85% (down from 95%)
- **More frequent monitoring**: Every 15 seconds (down from 30 seconds)  
- **Target memory limit**: 200MB (down from 400MB realistic limit)
- **Faster cleanup cycles**: Every 2 minutes with aggressive cleanup

### 2. Enhanced Garbage Collection
- **Multiple GC cycles**: Force 3 consecutive garbage collections during cleanup
- **Safer GC checks**: Added proper function type checking for `global.gc`
- **Frequent GC**: Every 60 seconds plus on-demand during high memory usage

### 3. Cache and Memory Optimizations
- **Aggressive require cache clearing**: Remove non-essential cached modules
- **Request payload limits**: Reduced from 10MB to 2MB for JSON/URL-encoded requests
- **String processing limits**: 1MB max string length with chunked processing
- **Memory leak detection**: Faster detection (5 consecutive increases vs 10)

### 4. Node.js Runtime Flags
- `--max-old-space-size=200`: Hard limit Node.js heap to 200MB
- `--optimize-for-size`: Prioritize memory efficiency over speed
- `--expose-gc`: Enable manual garbage collection
- Applied via environment variables for both dev and production

### 5. Monitoring Improvements
- **Real-time memory tracking**: RSS, heap usage, and percentage reporting
- **Early warning system**: Cleanup triggered at 180MB target vs 200MB limit
- **Detailed memory stats**: Track heap total, used, external memory
- **Performance correlation**: Link memory usage to response times

## Expected Results:
- **Target memory usage**: 150-180MB (down from 370MB+)
- **Improved stability**: Prevent memory-related crashes
- **Better performance**: Reduced GC pauses and memory pressure
- **Automatic recovery**: Self-healing memory management

## Monitoring:
Memory reports now show: `ðŸ“Š Memory: [USED]MB / 200MB ([%]%)`
- Green zone: <70% (under 140MB)
- Yellow zone: 70-85% (140-170MB)
- Red zone: >85% (over 170MB) - triggers aggressive cleanup

The system will now aggressively manage memory usage to stay well under the 400MB actual limit in Replit environments.
