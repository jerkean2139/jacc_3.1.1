# Website URL Scraping Feature - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The website URL scraping feature is now fully integrated into JACC's document management system. This powerful tool allows administrators to extract content from any website and automatically convert it into searchable documents.

## How It Works

### 1. Access the Feature
- Navigate to Admin Control Center â†’ Document Center
- Click the "Website URL Scraper" tab in the 3-step upload process
- Enter any website URL (e.g., https://stripe.com/docs/payments)

### 2. Automatic Processing
The system performs these steps automatically:
- **Web Scraping**: Uses Puppeteer to load the page with JavaScript rendering
- **Content Extraction**: Removes navigation, ads, and scripts to get clean content
- **HTML to Markdown**: Converts the content to clean markdown format
- **AI Analysis**: Generates summary and bullet points using Claude AI
- **Document Creation**: Creates a .md file with metadata and source links

### 3. Document Integration
- Scraped content becomes a searchable document in your knowledge base
- AI can reference this content when answering user questions
- Documents maintain source URLs for verification
- Content is processed into chunks for vector search

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Component
- **WebsiteURLScraper**: React component with URL validation and progress indicators
- **Real-time feedback**: Shows scraping progress and results preview
- **File creation**: Converts scraped content to File objects for upload process

### Backend Services
- **website-scraper.ts**: Main scraping service with Puppeteer and Cheerio
- **API endpoint**: `/api/scrape-website` for authenticated scraping requests
- **Fallback system**: Uses simple HTTP requests if Puppeteer fails
- **AI integration**: Connects to Claude for content summarization

### Content Processing
- **Text extraction**: Intelligent content selection from main page areas
- **Markdown conversion**: Uses Turndown library for clean formatting
- **Metadata generation**: Includes title, word count, scrape timestamp
- **Summary creation**: AI-generated summaries and key bullet points
