- **Issue**: Multiple overlapping implementations
- **Fix**: Consolidate or clarify purpose of each

### 6. **Test/Demo Pages** üß™ DEV TOOLS
- `/test-messages/:id` - Message testing page
- `/demo-admin` - Demo admin panel
- `/admin-login` - Alternative login page
- **Issue**: Development pages accessible in production
- **Fix**: Remove or restrict access

### 7. **Redundant Admin Panels** üîÑ CLEANUP NEEDED

- **Leaderboard**: Fixed SQL syntax, fully operational
- **Achievements**: All 5 endpoints working
- **Status**: Level 16, 1501 points displaying correctly

## üìã ACTIVATION PRIORITY

1. **HIGH PRIORITY - User-Facing Features**:
   - [ ] ISO-AMP Calculator - Uncomment routes
   - [ ] Merchant Insights - Remove "Coming Soon" styling
   - [ ] AI Prompts - Enable in sidebar

2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Performance**:
   - [ ] Verify performance optimization services integration
   - [ ] Test vector cache and query optimizer
   - [ ] Check if batch processor is being used

3. **LOW PRIORITY - Cleanup**:
   - [ ] Remove redundant admin panel files
   - [ ] Consolidate pricing implementations
   - [ ] Restrict test/demo pages

## üîß NEXT STEPS

1. Start with high-priority items that provide immediate user value
2. Test each feature after activation
3. Update navigation to reflect active features
4. Clean up redundant code to avoid future confusion

## üìù NOTES

- This pattern of disconnected features suggests incomplete migration
- Many features are production-ready but simply not exposed
- Gamification was the third instance of this pattern
- Systematic activation will prevent future "rush discoveries"
